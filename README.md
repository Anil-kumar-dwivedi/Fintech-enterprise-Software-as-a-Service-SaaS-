The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”

##  Problem Statement ML
In this project, I build a web application to help the people working in the Accounts Receivable departments in their day-to-day activities.  A web application where the users in the Account Receivable department can :<br/>

->View the invoice data from various buyers.<br/>
->See various fields/attributes of the invoice(s) from a particular buyer.<br/> 
->Perform Data Pre-processing on the invoice data.<br/>
->Get account-level analytics to easily visualize and interpret data- EDA and Feature Engineering.<br/>
->Get a prediction of when the invoice is going to get paid.<br/>

## Problem Statement for Web Application Development:
      The objective of the Web Application Development internship project is:
->To build a Full-stack Invoice Management Application using ReactJs, JDBC, Java, Servlets.<br/>
->Build a responsive Receivables Dashboard.<br/>
->Visualize Data in the form of grids.<br/>
->Visualize Data in the form of graphs.<br/>
->Perform Searching operations on the invoices.<br/>
->Add & Edit data in the editable fields of the grid.<br/>
->Delete data of selected rows in predefined templates.
